## SteamGridDB Helper

This app will download images from steamgriddb.com and use them in place of images in your Steam library. Don't like the blurry legacy landscape images and want all your games to follow Steam's new "boxart" model? Then you've come to the right place!

### FYI: This is a work in progress

I haven't even done anything yet.
